                <h3>Marching Band</h3>
                <p><strong>Years Active:</strong> Freshman Year 2021 - Junior Year 2024</p>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Drumline</p>
                <p>From my freshman year starting in 2021 to the end of my junior year in 2024, I actively participated in the Marching Band, dedicating myself to the drumline section. I also engaged in one season of indoor drumline. Our collective efforts earned us various awards, ranging from first in percussion to high ratings at festivals and competitions. Despite moments of physical and mental exhaustion, I persevered, motivated by the strong family bond within the band. Though I didn't hold an official officer position, as a member of the percussion section, I played a vital role in maintaining discipline and being a source of motivation and energy for everyone else.</p>

                <h3>Robotics</h3>
                <p><strong>Years Active:</strong> January 2024 - Present</p>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Programmer</p>
                <p>As a programmer for Saber Dynamics, I learned to work collaboratively and navigate complex coding libraries to solve issues. We met after school almost every day, committing countless hours. I am extremely passionate about robotics as it allows me to express my creative problem-solving skills and my love for STEAM. Although I wish I could dedicate more time to this activity, I need to focus on my senior year work-study program and early college courses.</p>

                <h3>Chess Club</h3>
                <p><strong>Years Active:</strong> Sophomore Year 2022 - Present</p>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Treasurer</p>
                <p>I have been involved in the Chess Club since my sophomore year of high school. During club meetings, members competed either in the library after school or during lunch periods in a classroom. The club has held numerous tournaments and competitions. At the end of my junior year, I was asked to take on the role of Treasurer, where I am responsible for fundraising, budgeting, and securing club sponsors. I plan to take on more responsibilities during my senior year.</p>

                <h3>STEAM Academy Ambassador</h3>
                <p><strong>Years Active:</strong> Sophomore Year 2022 - Present</p>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Ambassador</p>
                <p>As a STEAM Academy Ambassador, I worked to make my school a better place. My duties included recruiting students into the STEAM program, maintaining their interest, answering questions, conducting outreach, and representing STEAM well. Through this role, I developed strong leadership and time management skills. It sometimes required missing class to assist with events or staying after school to plan activities. I had the opportunity to volunteer and participate in community service at events like the Chamber of Commerce luncheons and Saber Showcase. Additionally, I helped recruit new STEAM students from local middle and intermediate schools. I assisted in planning spirit weeks, teacher and counselor appreciation weeks, and more.</p>
