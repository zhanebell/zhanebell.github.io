                <h3>Marching Band</h3>
                <p>Freshman Year 2021-Junior Year 2024</p>
                <p>Drumline</p>
                <p>From my freshman year starting in 2021 to the end of my junior year in 2024, I actively participated in the Marching Band. Throughout all three seasons, I dedicated myself to the drumline section. In addition to my commitment to drumline in the Marching Band, I also engaged in one season of indoor drumline. Across these years, our collective efforts earned us various awards, ranging from first in percussion to high ratings at festivals and competitions. Despite moments of exhaustion, both physical and mental, I persevered. The strong family bond within the band served as my anchor, motivating me to push through challenges. Though I didn't hold an official officer position, as a member of the percussion section, I played a vital role in maintaining discipline within the band and being the motivation and energy for everyone else.</p>

                <h3>Robotics</h3>
                <p>January 2024-Present</p>
                <p>Programmer</p>
                <p>As a programmer for Saber Dynamics, I learned how to work with others and read complex libraries to solve coding issues. We met after school almost every day of the week, committing countless hours. I am extremely passionate about robotics because I get to express my creative problem-solving side and my love for STEAM. I honestly wish I could commit more time to this activity, since I enjoy it very much, unfortunately, I have to take a step back to focus on my senior year work-study program and my early college courses.</p>

                <h3>Chess Club</h3>
                <p>Sophomore Year 2022-Present</p>
                <p>Treasurer</p>
                <p>I have also been involved in the Chess Club since my sophomore year of high school. During club meetings, members would compete either in the library after school or during lunch periods in a classroom. The club has held numerous tournaments and competitions. At the end of my junior year, I was asked to take on an officer position as Treasurer. I am in charge of fundraising, budgeting, and securing club sponsors in this role. I recently stepped into this position but plan to take on more responsibilities during my senior year.</p>

                <h3>STEAM Academy Ambassador</h3>
                <p>Sophomore Year 2022-Present</p>
                <p>Ambassador</p>
                <p>I have served as a STEAM Academy Ambassador, helping to make my school a better place. As an ambassador, my duties included recruiting students into the STEAM program, maintaining their interest, answering questions, conducting outreach, and representing STEAM well. Through this role, I developed strong leadership and time management skills. It sometimes required missing class to assist with events or staying after school to plan activities. I had the opportunity to volunteer and participate in community service at events like the Chamber of Commerce luncheons and Saber Showcase. Additionally, I helped recruit new STEAM students from local middle and intermediate schools. I assisted in planning spirit weeks, teacher and counselor appreciation weeks, and more.</p>
