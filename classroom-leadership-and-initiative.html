            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Leadership:</strong> I have held a couple of leadership positions throughout my high school years. I plan to maintain my role as a STEAM Academy Ambassador and chess club treasurer throughout my senior year. Aside from clubs, however, I naturally gravitate towards leadership both inside and outside the classroom. In class, I help my peers struggling with concepts, often explaining material when teachers find it challenging to relate with students. I lead group projects by organizing timelines and delegating tasks. Leadership, to me, isn't always formal; anyone can step up and lead. Additionally, at home, as the eldest of four siblings, I often assume responsibility for their care.

                    <strong>Intellectual Vitality:</strong> My passion for learning is evident in my rigorous coursework, personal projects, internships, and continuous pursuit of knowledge and problem-solving. I consistently enroll in the most challenging AP and early college courses, always striving to stretch my intellectual capabilities. I don't just complete these courses with minimal effort; I excel in them, dedicating significant time to each of them. I further my learning with additional online resources and aim to obtain computer science certifications throughout my senior year. Through personal projects, I enhance my coding skills and explore new technologies and frameworks. Continuous learning is a big part of my daily routine; I stay updated on the latest tech news through newsletters, books, and livestreamed technology events and showcases. To demonstrate my love for learning, I am writing my personal statement and common application essay on my relationship with mathematics. You can check out my most recent drafts of my essays on my College Research tabs!
