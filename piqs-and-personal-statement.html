                <h2>Personal Statement and PIQ Responses</h2>
                <p>Curiosity is the overarching theme of my application. I intend to emphasize my passion for mathematics and computer science and my ability to discover creative solutions to problems. I possess creativity and innovation, but my thirst for knowledge and understanding of complex concepts also shines through in my application. Learning, to me, is an ongoing journey with no end. Curiosity propels me to explore subjects and establish connections across various academic disciplines. For instance, I may often connect what I am learning between my computer science class and real-world events covered in history or English classes. Furthermore, my curiosity extends to my coding projects, job, and personal life.</p>
                <p><strong>Inventive:</strong>I consistently showcase my creative abilities in all of my classes. I can find new and original solutions to problems and think outside the box. In my personal life, I demonstrate creativity through productivity "hacks," aimed at automating aspects of my routine using apps and technology programs. However, sometimes an existing app or program doesn't meet my specific needs. In those cases, I create my solutions. The reason I chose computer science as my field of study is because I like the idea of creating something that does not already exist or improving upon tools that aren't fully optimized. In my projects, I have made file organizers and productivity organizers using coding languages like Python and Java, applying the knowledge gained from my classes to real-life scenarios. That's why coding is my favorite subject—because it allows me to exercise my creativity both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
                <p><strong>Ambitious:</strong>Whether academically, professionally, or in my personal life, I am always ambitious. There's a saying that has truly altered my perspective. You've probably heard it before, but it goes like this: "If can can, if no can no can." My version, however, is "if can can, if no can still can," which essentially means finding a solution to a problem no matter the obstacles. Aware of my limitations and capabilities, I consistently push myself to the edge. In my coding projects for school, I consistently exceed the required components, taking everything to the next level. A prime example is my performance task for AP Computer Science Principles. I chose to recreate chess entirely in Python without any external libraries. For those unfamiliar with programming, this means without the aid of pre-existing programs—just me, some math, and a lot of hours coding. This chess bot possesses some degree of game knowledge and automatically plays moves against opponents. I took on this project due to my deep interest in the future of machine learning and artificial intelligence, believing in their potential to positively transform the world. (In fact, they're already doing so.) I'm ambitious: regardless of how tight a deadline is or how limited my resources are, I maintain the mindset that I can overcome any challenge. I never deem anything impossible. I dream big and deliver. In the rare event that I say something is truly impossible, it is because I have already spent a crazy amount of time trying to do it.</p>
                <p><strong>Complex thinker:</strong>In all my classes, I think very deeply about concepts. Whether calculating math formulas, solving equations, tackling coding issues through debugging, or analyzing complex literary texts, I exhibit a strong analytical mindset. My favorite subject in school is math, which might come as a surprise given my application’s strong focus on computer science (also constituting a significant portion of my academic focus). While I love computer science, my fascination with mathematics has existed since I was very young. Mathematics, to me, exhibits elegance, beauty, and much satisfaction. The existence of multiple solutions to a problem with only one correct answer has always fascinated me. Among all the math courses I've taken, what I love most is discovering formulas to problem-solve. While it's convenient when handed a formula to address some complex problem, the incomparable feeling of satisfaction arises when I can craft my own elegant, generalized solution. The thrill of "uncovering the math" exhilarates me. Furthermore, I have gotten good at breaking down complex issues into manageable components to find solutions. My passion for math seamlessly transitions into my love for computer science, given its heavy reliance on mathematical principles, which is especially evident in fields like machine learning, where calculus plays a big role. Similarly, in English classes (while I may not enjoy the subject as much as math) I appreciate the opportunities I have to combine the two subjects. Throughout my high school journey, I have often used my analytical skills from math to understand and interpret complex literary texts, identifying themes, motifs, and deeper meanings within the texts.</p>
                <p><strong>Curious:</strong>As I have gone through my years of school, I have begun to prioritize learning over grades. (It just so happens that my love for learning has led me to have good grades.) Across all my courses, I've consistently shown a desire to dive deeper than what's covered in the classroom. I previously mentioned my love for math, particularly my fascination with finding formulas. Understanding how things work isn't sufficient for me; I want to comprehend WHY math concepts are the way they are. While someone might present me with a series of complex math identities that I am expected to assume are true, I'm driven to uncover the underlying reasons why they work. What visual aids can better my understanding? What additional proofs support these identities? Who devised them, and how did they do it? I always strive to ask just one more question, often leading me down a rabbit hole of learning new things. </p>
                <p><strong>Organized + Resourceful:</strong>I pride myself on being exceptionally organized in all areas of my life. If asked about one thing I couldn't live without, it would likely be my laptop. Equipped with many productivity applications, it serves as the ultimate tool for managing my school assignments, personal events, and work calendar. Essentially, it's a digital version of my brain. I plan out my weeks on this device, enabling me to accomplish tasks efficiently and on time. I love color coding and setting early deadlines for myself. I like to stay organized in all that I do. Additionally, I'm highly resourceful. Whether encountering challenges in coding class, mathematics, or personal projects, I possess the skills to seek solutions online. I effectively communicate with my teachers to request assistance, and I love going to the library to do research and discover books that might hold answers to my questions or problems. I prefer using my resources before simply being handed a solution. To me, the journey of research and problem-solving holds greater value than an immediate answer. </p>
